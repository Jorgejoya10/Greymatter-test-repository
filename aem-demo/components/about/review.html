    <p>
      Lily’s journey with flowers began in the heart of Oregon, amidst the flourishing fields
      of her aunts’ flower farm. It was there, surrounded by the abundance of nature, that she
      discovered her passion for floral design. From learning the names of each bloom to
      understanding the delicate balance of a bouquet, she absorbed the artistry of flowers
      like the rich Oregon soil.

    <p>
      Bloom & Co. is the expression of that lifelong passion, a place where her love for flowers
      translates into beautifully curated arrangements that bring joy and elegance to your spaces.
